# v0.1.8.3 Post-Change Sweep Optimization Report

**Generated:** 2026-05-25T22:07:47Z
**Git HEAD:** `ac09d75`
**v0.1.8.2 tag:** `9d8dfc8`

## Purpose

Record reproducible timing evidence for the v0.1.8.3 single-core sweep optimization cycle.
The workloads are intentionally public-API based and are designed to be rerun before and after optimization.

## Environment

| label | r_version | platform | os | logical_cores | physical_cores |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| post_change | 4.5.2 | x86_64-w64-mingw32 | Windows | 24 | 16 |

## Package Versions

| package | version |
| --- | --- |
| ledgr | 0.1.8.2 |
| pkgload | 1.4.1 |
| testthat | 3.3.1 |
| duckdb | 1.4.3 |
| DBI | 1.2.3 |
| tibble | 3.3.0 |

## Workload Results

| scenario | path | n_candidates | n_instruments | n_days | n_bars | feature_mode | metric_context | reps | median_sec | mean_sec | min_sec | max_sec |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| persistent_comparison | sweep_plain | 5 | 4 | 252 | 1008 | single | default | 5 | 1.40 | 1.634 | 1.34 | 2.61 |
| persistent_comparison | run_loop | 5 | 4 | 252 | 1008 | single | default | 5 | 7.96 | 8.294 | 7.61 | 9.82 |

## Interpretation Notes

- Post-change measurements must use the same workload definitions as the baseline.
- Compare this report with `baseline_report.md` before making performance claims.
- If the scoped optimization does not improve the reference workload, document why it still ships or defer/revert the change.
